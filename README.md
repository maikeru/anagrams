anagrams
========

From the Anagram Code Kata http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_six_anagra.html

Quoting from the code kata page
-------------------------------
The challenge is fairly simple: given a file containing one word per line, print out all the combinations of words that are anagrams; each line in the output contains all the words from the input that are anagrams of each other. For example, your program might include in its output:

  kinship pinkish
  enlist inlets listen silent
  boaster boaters borates
  fresher refresh
  sinks skins
  knits stink
  rots sort
